				I was always told I was a writer.
			</p>
<p>
Ever since I can remember, writing came so easily to me. In elementary school words would flow from my pencil with great ease. I rarely had to make outlines or even think about what I would write next. Any story or poem I wrote just “happened.” In fourth grade I wrote my first “novel” about a girl that loved horses and lived on a farm. That same year I also wrote about a horse I used to ride when I lived in Canada, Sissi, which was published in a book of poems by children. Songs, short stories, long stories, poems, articles… I wrote it all, and I loved doing it. I also loved to read and be read to. Without me knowing it at the time, books would transport my mind into another world and really let my creativity grow.
</p>
<p>
Then fifth grade came.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to write fiction, my favorite genre, however I was told I couldn’t. Nor could I read it. Instead, the ability to express myself and expand my imagination was crushed, and I was limited to writing and reading non-fiction and essays. I hated it.
